## Hey! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.
This was a challenge given by frontend mentor.

## Learnings 🎯

I learned how to build a project completely from scratch,
also the designs were provided and i needed to code it
in a way that it matches exactly like the original project.

Learnt a lot while enjoying building the project 😁

Happy Coding! 💻
